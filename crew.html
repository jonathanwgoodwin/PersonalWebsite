<strong>Crew:</strong><br>
I am a part of Northeastern's Undergraduate Experimental Systems Group (Crew). We test new techologies, and do projects for the College of Computer and Information Science (CCIS). There are two projects that I am specifically involved in:<br><br>
<strong>Crew U:</strong><br>
Crew U is a project I am leading to help people get up to speed with the basic techologies we use in Crew so that they can begin to participate on projects much faster. We are in the process of creating a website where new members can find resources such as: A basic Linux tutorial; links to other tutorials for more Advanced Linux topics; breief descriptions of the other software, languages and tools we use as well as links to good tutorials or ducmentation of those techologies. Over the summer we hope to put to together a series of video lectures that would cover the material outlined in our Linux tutorials.<br><br>
<strong>Metrics:</strong><br>
Metrics is a project to measure the use of the machines in the CCIS lab, in order to get a better idea of how and when the machines were being used.
